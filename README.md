# 3DRenderingTechniques

This is the demo code (and slides) for a presentation I gave at Cocoaheads SLC in July of 2016.

It presents three different methods of rendering a 3D scene using 3 different rendering techniques. Scanline Rasterization, Monte Carlo Path Tracing, and Raycasting. All rendering is done in software.

Slides are also included in the repo.
